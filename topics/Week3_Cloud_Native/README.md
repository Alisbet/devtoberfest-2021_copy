## Presentations

### Jens Keller "Microservices are Probably Not What You Think They Are"
Date and Time: Tuesday, October 19th at 09:00 CEST / 15:00 SGT / 03:00 EDT

Duration: 50 mins

Every company that claims to be a cloud company, claims to be developing Microservices. Yet it is one of the most misunderstood concepts in the software industry, and the misunderstandings already start with the name. If those misunderstandings can be sorted out, organizations see tremendous benefits to their structure and processes. Unfortunately, there’s a catch - there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch. In this talk we will explore the details.

Duration: 50 mins



Challenges are a very real part of daily life. Some challenges are very apparent, like having one finger on each hand. Other challenges, are less apparent but no
less of a hurdle that must be jumped. As someone who was born different and has been challenged through life, I have a very interesting view on hitting challenges
head on. I also like to laugh as I deal with these challenges. In this session we will joke our way through having an attitude of iteration in how we deal with
challenges in our personal lives AND in our work lives. Prepare to laugh, commiserate, and face your challenges!

[Join us live on YouTube](TBD), prepared to be entertained!

</td>  <td><b>Eric Johnson</b> is a public speaker who tackles the topics of everyday life as someone who is just a bit different. Eric is a father of five kids,
four of which are just like him with one finger on each hand and one toe on each foot. This difference gives Eric a uncommon view on overcoming challenges in his
own life as well as helping others to face life's challenges head on.

Eric has shared his unique blend of comedy, faith, and stark reality in corporations, churches, schools, and clubs. His positive attitude and challenging words have helped individuals and companies overcome challenges and move toward success.
