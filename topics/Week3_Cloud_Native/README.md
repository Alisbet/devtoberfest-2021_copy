* **Jens Keller** – Microservices are Probably Not What You Think They Are
  * ![Jens Keller](../../images/JensKeller_250px_shade.png)

  * **Bio:** During his career, Jens has worked in several product units of different maturity (new projects, growing projects, legacy projects) and size (from ~10 to several 1000), using different technologies (ABAP, HANA, Java, JavaScript, UI5, Node.js). And throughout he has seen many teams struggling in their “cloud transformation”. Being a full-stack engineer who also worked as Scrum Master and Product Owner, Jens is now working as a trainer and coach for various technical and non-technical topics such as Cloud-Native Development, Continuous Delivery, DevOps and Agile Software Engineering; with the mission to help teams and organizations getting ready for the cloud.

  * **Abstract:** Every company that claims to be a cloud company, claims to be developing Microservices. Yet it is one of the most misunderstood concepts in the software industry, and the misunderstandings already start with the name. If those misunderstandings can be sorted out, organizations see tremendous benefits to their structure and processes. Unfortunately, there’s a catch - there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch. In this talk we will explore the details.
