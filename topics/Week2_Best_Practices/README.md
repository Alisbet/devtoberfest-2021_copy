### Mission: Build an Application End-to-End Using CAP, Node.js and VS Code

Develop a business application using SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP). Start on your local environment, enhance it with an SAP Fiori UI, and add business logic to it. Add a Launch Page to start the UIs, add roles, and authorization check and enable the Logging service. Set up SAP HANA Cloud as a database and deploy your application to SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) as a Multi-Target Application (MTA).
