## Devtoberfest Contest – The Game
For Devtoberfest 2021 we have a game that is open to everyone regardless of developer level.  Points can be accrued by completing items listed below that range from attending a presentation to completing tutorials on SAP Community. Prizes are awarded based on badges earned and associated points accumulated.  Prize and Points are described below as well as the rules relating to how many winners will make it to the Grand Prize Winner drawing.

## Game Board – A Place to check your game level status.
[The Game Board](https://devrel-tools-prod-scn-badges-srv.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/devtoberfestContest/) is a static infographic that you can use to see your status.

## Points – Awarded and accumulated against your SAP Community ID.
This table includes a sample of some events that you can earn a badge with points associated.  Once that badge is applied to your SAP Community ID you will be able to see your points status change on [the Devtoberfest Gameboard](https://devrel-tools-prod-scn-badges-srv.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/devtoberfestContest/).  More events will be published in future weeks of Devtoberfest, including a list after week 3 of a special group of 20 tutorials (Scavenger Hunt) as a Devtoberfest Mission with bonus points awarded if all 20 tutorials completed.

## Game Specific Rules
* You must complete the items described in the point activity grid to receive prizes
* SAP will count the points by verifying your participation badges
* Once we have distributed our prizes out for levels 1-3 there will be no more prizes available.
* One grand prize winner (4 Stars) will be given even if more than one person achieves the total points needed for 4 stars.  All 4 star qualifiers will have their name written on a piece of paper and placed in a bowl. Then SAP will have someone draw a name from that bowl on a recorded video camera segment.
