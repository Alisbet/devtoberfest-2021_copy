### Alan Simon "The Modern Enterprise Data Landscape"
November 2nd, 17:00 CET / 9am MST

Enterprise-scale data management has long been a highly complex and often frustrating proposition. Today, with data warehouses and data marts, data lakes, data lakehouses, data fabric, data mesh, in-memory databases and more… your alternatives can be mind-numbing and make you feel as if you’ll never reach your enterprise data management goals.

40-year technology veteran Alan Simon untangles and demystifies the enterprise data management landscape, helping you leap beyond jargon and the latest hot trends through a grounded-in-reality approach to address your longstanding challenges. No matter where you are on the path towards a true enterprise data landscape throughout your organization, this presentation will help you move even further along your roadmap.

But as Data is moving into 3xV directions (Volume, Velocity and Variety) so is modern Visualization of it.
