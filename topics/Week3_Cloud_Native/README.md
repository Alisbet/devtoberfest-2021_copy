## Presentations

### Jens Keller "Microservices are Probably Not What You Think They Are"
Date and Time: Tuesday, October 19th at 09:00 CEST / 15:00 SGT / 03:00 EDT

Duration: 50 mins

Every company that claims to be a cloud company, claims to be developing Microservices. Yet it is one of the most misunderstood concepts in the software industry, and the misunderstandings already start with the name. If those misunderstandings can be sorted out, organizations see tremendous benefits to their structure and processes. Unfortunately, there’s a catch - there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch. In this talk we will explore the details.

### Eric Johnson "Attitude of Iteration"

Duration: 50 mins



Challenges are a very real part of daily life. Some challenges are very apparent, like having one finger on each hand. Other challenges, are less apparent but no
less of a hurdle that must be jumped. As someone who was born different and has been challenged through life, I have a very interesting view on hitting challenges
head on. I also like to laugh as I deal with these challenges. In this session we will joke our way through having an attitude of iteration in how we deal with
challenges in our personal lives AND in our work lives. Prepare to laugh, commiserate, and face your challenges!

[Join us live on YouTube](TBD), prepared to be entertained!
