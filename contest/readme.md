* Once we have distributed our prizes out for levels 1-3 there will be no more prizes available.
* One grand prize winner (4 Stars) will be given even if more than one person achieves the total points needed for 4 stars.  All 4 star qualifiers will have their name written on a piece of paper and placed in a bowl. Then SAP will have someone draw a name from that bowl on a recorded video camera segment.
