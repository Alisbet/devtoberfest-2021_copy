### Data Visualization: Then and Now
November 4th, 10:00 CET / 5pm SGT

Data Visualization is the new old topic. Surprisingly its history is not that long even if spreadsheets made data exploration ubiquitous. But as Data is moving into 3xV directions (Volume, Velocity and Variety) so is modern Visualization of it. After going through a bit of a theory we will move into practical aspects of Data Storytelling and Exploratory Data Analysis.
